Project 1: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Scenario:
An E-Mail from the Research Company:

Dear Vinny & Julia,

It was very nice to meet and chat with you at the event where we just met and had a nice chat. We would love to take the next steps together to see if working together makes sense for both parties.

As we mentioned, we want to leverage the power of data and analytics to optimize the effectiveness of street teamwork, which is an important part of our fundraising efforts.

Our WomenTechWomenYes (WTWY) association organizes an annual gala every year at the beginning of the summer season. As we are a new and inclusive organization, we strive to do double duty with gala to both fill our event space with individuals passionate about increasing women's participation in technology and at the same time create awareness and reach.

For this purpose, we place street teams at the entrances of metro stations. Street teams collect the e-mail addresses of the people they can reach and send free tickets to our gala to those who register.

Where we want to ask you for help is to use MTA metro data, which I'm sure you know is available free of charge from the city, to help us optimize the layout of our street crews so we can reach as many people as can attend the gala and contribute to our cause.

The ball is now on your court, we will be eagerly awaiting the results of your work in the nearest future.

Love...

Karrine & Dahlia
